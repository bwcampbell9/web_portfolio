        I made this site using React and Material UI

    <p class="body-text">
        Before I made this website my dad would always complain about how hard it was to control his smart lights. The manufacturer's app was not intuitive for him and didn't have the features he wanted.
    </p>
    <p class="body-text">
        After enough complaining, I did some research and found that the smart lights had an API to control them. I realized it would be easy to write a simple web app that made use of the API to provide my dad with the features he wanted.
    </p>
    <p class="body-text">
        For this website, I wrote the front end in React using Material UI. It provides a list of light groups and several options to control and schedule them based on time, random offset, and even sunrise and sunset. To make it all work the front end communicates with a back end I wrote with Express.js. The backend receives requests and uses the Phillips Hue API to turn on and off lights at the right times.

        I loved being able to gain experience working on a project that solved a real world problem for someone I know!
