            <p>My name is Bryce Campbell. I had my first taste of coding in elementary school with the simple drag and drop language Scratch, and I've been coding ever since. I have always loved the challenge of solving new problems, throughout middle and high school I took every chance I could get to learn more, following online tutorials and going to summer camps and classes. Now I am a third-year Computer Science major at Cal Poly and I still love programming, weather it's for a class or a personal project.</p>

            <h3>PLEXIL Intern</h3>
            <h6>NASA Planning & Scheduling Group - Intelligent Systems Division</h6>
            <p>As an intern at NASA, I worked on the Plan Execution Interchange Language (PLEXIL) Executive. I worked with experienced mentors to design and implement new features in the language. I improved learning resources and made quality of life additions to the compilation script. My largest project, however, was writing an overhaul to the command and lookup handling infrastructure in PLEXIL. I shifted work from the programmer to the executive by moving command and lookup handling from the old chained conditional approach to a new method of registering handlers into a hash table. After this change, it has become easy and efficient to add commands and lookups to an autonomous system in PLEXIL.</p>
